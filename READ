All maps that ThatElijah has either contributed to, ported, or created will be here.
If you have any questions you can contact me by going to pavlovscore.com and joining the discord.
DISCLAIMER: I, ThatElijah am not responsible for any damages or problems you have while using my maps, use them at your own risk!
(Even though the maps won't break anything I know there are not very likeable people that would sue if they stubbed their toe in VR while playing one of my maps)
